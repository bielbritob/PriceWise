- improve the scrapScript, add an algorithm that if the product not exist in site the algorithm return that to user. [...]

- improve the product finder(sometimes dont display correctly product(some times the user search 'azeite' and hopes to see smth like 'azeite 180ml vidro' not 'atum em molho de azeite'))
